INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS Application and admission requirements for international students and local students writing international examinations: • The closing date for applications from international students for undergraduate study is 31 August 2025. • You must have a VALID study visa endorsed for study at the UFS, and not any other institution in South Africa, before entering South Africa to study at the UFS. • A non-refundable annual administrative levy is charged on all international student accounts. • Students from outside the Southern African Development Community (SADC) pay international fees, which are 50% more per module per year compared to the fees paid by South African students. • A Universities South Africa (USAf) Certificate of Exemption is required if you do not have an Endorsed South African Senior Certificate. For applicants who are currently in Grade 12, the UFS may make conditional offers based on the final Grade 11 results. If any other results are available, kindly submit them as well with your application. • Cambridge and international students – please note that you need to submit your predicted results/mid-year results to the Office for International Affairs at OIAstudentadmin@ufs.ac.za as soon as you receive them from your school. If you do not have matriculation exemption, the Office for International Affairs (OIA) will assist you with the application for the USAf certificate of exemption. You will have to pay the prescribed fee before the Office for International Affairs will attend to the USAf exemption application. You must pay and submit the relevant documentation as soon as you receive the final Grade 12 results. • A first payment is required before you can register as a UFS student. The Department of Student Finance will communicate the amount and payment deadline to you. • Should you fail to pay your tuition fees in total by 30 June, your registration will be suspended. • If you have a scholarship, inform your sponsor of the UFS regulations on registration fees and tuition fee payments before you register. It is important to distinguish between ‘Grade 12 statement of results’ and ‘Matric Certificate’. USAf does not issue ‘conditional exemption certificates’ based on Grade 11 and mid-year Grade 12 results. Current Grade 12 learners apply for exemption when the final Grade 12 statement of results is available in January. If you meet the exemption requirements with your final Grade 12 ‘statement of results’, USAf will issue a ‘conditional exemption letter’. The actual exemption certificate will only be issued on receipt of a Matric Certificate (available around May). You must be a member of a medical aid registered in terms of the South African Medical Schemes Act, as required by the South African Immigration Act. Your medical aid MUST be valid for the duration of the academic year (until 31 December), renewable each year. No travel insurance, hospital plans, or foreign medical aids will be accepted. The UFS cannot offer financial support (bursaries, loans) to international students. It is therefore important to ensure that you have sufficient financial resources for the planned duration of your studies. English is the principal medium of instruction; therefore, you must have an adequate command of the English language. 52 CONVERSION TABLE If you are an international and/or home-schooled prospective student, use the conversion table below to calculate your admission point (AP). internationally (upload international results as symbols). and is a guideline only.

To avoid the stress and anxiety about your finances, you are advised to source and secure funds when you apply for studies at the UFS to support yourself in terms of registration fees, books, meals, accommodation, transport, etc., while you wait for the bursary to pay out. Do not wait until the last minute. The University of the Free State offers the following bursaries for qualifying students: ACADEMIC MERIT AWARDS FOR NEW FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS The UFS offers academic merit awards for first-year students. You have worked very hard and the UFS values and acknowledges your effort. You can use your merit award allocation to register. If your merit award is less than the required registration fee, you will have to pay the balance to finalise your registration. The university reserves the right to amend the regulations and award values and/or conditions applicable to the awarding thereof without prior notice. If you qualify for an academic merit award, we will credit your class fee account with the amount of the award after you register as a student at the University of the Free State. The following scale is used to allocate awards: Enquiries for bursaries, NSFAS, and merit bursaries: +27 51 401 9111 (option 3) NSFAS call centre: 08000 67327 These awards are automatically awarded to new students based on their performance in the final matriculation examination. The award offer is subject to you meeting the minimum admission requirements in your programme of study and being registered at the UFS as a first-year student in 2026. 58 UNIVERSITY OF THE FREESTATE  UNDERGRADUATE PROSPECTUS 2026 First-year students who initially registered at other higher-education institutions First-time entering first-year students who initially registered at other higher-education institutions, discontinued their studies, and then register at the University of the Free State, will not qualify for academic merit awards during their first year of study. What does this mean? If you transfer to the UFS from another university, you cannot get an academic merit award based on your final Grade 12 results during your first year of study at the UFS. Interruption of studies To qualify for an academic merit award, a student must register at the University of the Free State as a student again. If there is an interruption of more than five (5) years between the last examination (matric or university) and the year in which the award must be awarded, the student does not qualify for an award. What does this mean? If you interrupt your studies for more than five (5) years, you will lose the academic merit award. Discontinuation of study If a student discontinues his/her course during the year, the award will be recovered pro rata. What does this mean? If you have an award and stop studying, any credit balance on your UFS class-fee account (up to an amount equal to that of the award) will be taken away after you have discontinued your studies. Payment of academic merit award Students who qualify for an academic merit award will have the awarded amount credited to their tuition-fee account after registration at the UFS. What does this mean? You will not get cash; the money will be paid into your student account at the UFS. Undertaking The student undertakes to complete his/her degree studies at this university. If he/she does not complete the course, Council reserves the right to claim back the entire awarded amount or the part thereof that may already have been paid out. However, each case will be treated on merit. An award may be withdrawn at any time if the behaviour, diligence, or progress of the student is found to be unsatisfactory. If the examination results of a merit-award recipient are such that he/she will have to repeat the studies of a full year/semester, the award will be regarded as a study loan, and it will have to be paid back. What does this mean? If you get an academic merit award from the UFS, you can only complete your studies at the UFS. If you don’t complete the qualification, you may have to pay back all the money, or some of it. It depends on your specific situation. If you do not perform well academically, or behave badly, you may lose the award. Occasional Studies Students who register for occasional studies do not qualify for merit awards based on their academic achievement of the previous year or academic achievements during their occasional studies. The university reserves the right to amend the regulations and award values and/or conditions applicable to the allocation of awards without prior notice. Terms and conditions apply.

The policy emphasises the university’s unwavering commitment to safety and the integration of security into everyday campus life, ensuring the well- being of students, faculty, staff, contractors and visitors. The approach aligns with the policy’s goal of fostering a secure environment that is essential to the thriving UFS experience. By introducing these technical upgrades as well as other security enhancement measures, the university’s Department of Protection Services is demonstrating its commitment to creating and maintaining a safe campus environment as outlined in its strategic plan. These actions underscore the importance of shared responsibility in maintaining a safe and vibrant campus life. The UFS Security Policy booklet encourages all community members to stay informed and engaged in security practices, reinforcing the collective effort to uphold the university’s fundamental values of safety and security. 65 At Student Affairs, we take care of you while you are a student on either our Bloemfontein, South, or Qwaqwa campuses; we do this through our student life communities, the Centre for Universal Access and Disability Support – or CUADS as it is known, Student Counselling and Development, and Student Governance. The Department of Student Life and Communities purposefully fosters close collaboration with faculties and academic units to create a seamless integration between the social life and academic performance contexts of our students. A balance between academic responsibilities and vibrant student life is achieved through strong student communities and co-curricular programmes such as leadership development. As a Kovsie student, you will get the opportunity to be exposed to learning experiences outside the classroom that are intentionally designed to develop you into a well-rounded graduate. The Centre for Universal Access and Disability Support (CUADS) assists students in gaining access to support regarding communication, for example Sign Language interpreting services; accessible study material, for example Braille; alternative assessment arrangements, such as concessions; and individual academic support through assistive devices. We know that leaving home and moving to a new city to study is very challenging, and all our students are doing the best they can. To help you on your way and support you throughout your Kovsie journey, Student Counselling and Development is a key partner. It is important to know that you are not alone and that we, as the UFS, really care about your well-being. Therefore, we provide online resources as well as individual and group counselling to registered UFS students who are experiencing personal, psychological, and behavioural difficulties or require career guidance. We furthermore aid and support students on their journey of personal development in order to function to their full potential and effectively meet their educational and life goals. The mental, physical, and emotional well-being of our students is very important, and we take every measure to ensure that you enjoy your student years and develop holistically. The fourth piece that completes the Student Affairs picture is Student Governance. We strongly believe in governance excellence, capacity building of our students through the promotion of professional student governance, and a complete humanising experience. The Student Representative Council or SRC, responsible for facilitating activities such as SRC elections, developmental training, and strategic planning, plays a key role on all three campuses. The office also embarks on hosting other activities, which include public conversations and seminars. These activities promote the active participation of student leadership in institutional governance. Student governance, among others, drives the following: • student participation and a sense of belonging and inclusivity through co-curriculum programmes and governance activities • a strong governance culture that acts as a foundation for the advancement of transformation policies • institutional and campus SRC and student parliaments, structured student governance training programmes, student organisations and associations, student governance structures, namely class representatives through which the faculty councils are constituted; first-year committees, residence subcommittees, and residence committees. At the University of the Free State, we believe that every voice counts; therefore, our student leaders are actively participating in university and faculty governance and management structures. Student Affairs on all three campuses echoes the spirit of the University of the Free State. Here you will find a home away from home and experience the care, protection, and support you deserve. Choose the University of the Free State and experience why ‘only a Kovsie knows the feeling’.

When you become a Kovsie, we want you to feel that you belong to a circle of friends, and that you belong to a community. A community that will support and inspire you to reach your full potential. This sense of belonging is facilitated through college communities. UFS college communities are created through small pockets or groups that build towards larger communities. We encourage you to become a member of these cohesive groups through on-campus residences or day residences. Together, these groups form the strong building blocks of larger communities called College Communities. College Communities are created by clustering on-campus residences, day residences, and accredited accommodation, which then collaborate with other stakeholders such as faculties, support services, and different Student Affairs departments. The college communities form the social spaces where you can engage in all student-life programmes, e.g., cultural events, sports events, community-service events, dialogues, etc. In a community, we create an opportunity for engagement and communication. We have different student development programmes, such as: • leadership, where you can be a residence committee member and lead your residence on different university platforms; • mentorship, where a support structure is created for first-years’ transition to the university; • arts and culture programmes, which are platforms for students to showcase their different talents; • sport activities: as a Kovsie student, you will continue to enhance your sports talent and if you are committed enough, you can represent Kovsies on national and international level. Residences are communities created for students to develop outside the classroom. Each residence community has a residence head and a residence committee that oversees each residence. This leadership structure is responsible for managing residences and seeing to it that all activities offered are in line with the vision, mission, and values of the university. On-campus residences Your residence at the UFS will become your second home; life in a student residence at the UFS can be a very exciting and rewarding experience. As a Kovsie student, you will benefit from a whole new world of friendships that can last a lifetime. There are many people from different language, racial, and cultural backgrounds on campus. Living and learning in this diverse environment can give you a definite advantage over many other job seekers once you graduate, which will help you later in life. The leadership in residence communities consists of a residence head, prime, residence committee, and peer mentors. This leadership team creates a residence environment where every student feels welcome and inspired. All residence communities are driven by a set of shared values, which mediates a culture of mutual accountability. First-year students are supported in their transition to higher education by means of a peer-mentor system in residences. Each first-year student is allocated a peer mentor who facilitates individual conversation as well as conversations in small-group format with students. There are different types of residences – historical and older residences, and modern and newer buildings with different student communities.

If you do not live on campus, a day residence gives you the opportunity to participate in organised student activities. It is very important to us that you have the opportunity to develop as a complete person by participating in academic and non- academic activities on campus. With day residences, you can participate in all activities offered in campus residences. If you live off campus, you are free to join one of the day residence communities. Each day residence has a gazellie (or a large lounge with a kitchen and bathroom) on the campus, where the day residence communities host residence meetings, study, or just hang out and socialise. 73 We are future focused.

Protect yourself and the property of the university. Any damage and/or theft must be reported to the Division of Protection Services. Distinguish between fun and crime and respect other people’s property. Vehicles on campus It is recommended that students keeping vehicles on campus should take out SASRIA (riot insurance). All students and members of the public who wish to use the roads on campus should purchase an access disk issued by the Division of Protection Services of the university. The disc must be displayed on the windscreen. If you do not have an access permit, you could receive a traffic fine. People using the roads on the university campus or parking on the campus do so at their own risk and the university does not accept responsibility for any accident, loss, or damage. Any damage or theft must be reported to the Division of Security Services. 82 83 GLOSSARY University: An institution of advanced study and research in the arts and sciences where the highest possible academic qualification can be obtained. Chancellor: The Chancellor is the ceremonial head of the university and is generally a prominent figure in society. Our Chancellor is Prof Bonang Mohale. Vice-Chancellor and Principal: The Vice-Chancellor is the Chief Executive Officer of the university, with deputy vice-chancellors supporting him. Prof Francis Petersen is our Vice-Chancellor and Principal. University Council: The University Council is the highest decision-making body of the university. The Council consists of representatives of the university, the Student Representative Council (SRC), church and community representatives, prominent businesspeople, and individuals appointed by the government. Faculty: The students, lecturers, researchers, and management of a group of departments (in a broad sense) working in the same field of study, form a faculty. The head of a faculty is called a dean, who resides on the Bloemfontein Campus. Department: The students, lecturers, research, and management activities in a specific field of study form a department. At the head of a department, we find the departmental head or departmental chairperson. For undergraduate courses, you will be required to attend classes in various departments, while postgraduate studies are generally undertaken in a single department. Professor: A person who has distinguished himself/herself as an expert in a specific field of study. Lecturer: The name assigned to a person who presents classes to students. Each department has a number of lecturers who are experts in specific fields of study and who are attached full-time to the university. Lecturing staff are addressed in terms of their titles. Kovsie: The historical word ‘Kovsie’ is the nickname given to students at the UFS. This is also the general name used for referring to the UFS. Degree: An academic achievement that provides evidence that you are academically competent in a specific field of study, so that you may embark upon a career or careers related to this field. Undergraduate refers to students who are studying for the first degree, while the term postgraduate refers to students engaged in a study field where they have already obtained a degree. For example, the term degree could denote a BA degree (Baccalaureus Artium/Bachelor of Arts), a BCom degree (Baccalaureus Commercii/Bachelor of Commerce), or a BSc degree (Baccalaureus Scientiae/Bachelor of Science). The minimum period of study for an undergraduate bachelor’s degree is generally three or four years. This is followed by an honours degree (generally one or two years) or a master’s degree (one or more years), and finally a doctorate (generally two years or longer). Some degrees lead directly into certain professions, while other degrees provide general preparation for a variety of careers. A general BCom degree will equip you with the necessary economic and management knowledge so that, for example, you may apply for a position as a manager in a company. Module: A module refers to specific fields of study within a discipline. For example, Financial Management is one of several modules in the field of study known as Business Management. The Academic Calendar: An academic year consists of two semesters. The first semester usually commences in February, and the second semester by the end of July. In between, there is generally a holiday of approximately three weeks. The second semester is concluded at the end of November. Undergraduate students write an examination at the end of each semester. For postgraduate studies, much more self- study and research are expected from students. Any other questions?

Encircled by diverse provinces and the mountain kingdom of Lesotho, it is a gateway to an array of South African experiences. The Free State’s fertile soil yields abundance that feeds the nation, and its landscapes captivate – with a dramatic blend of expansive plains and the awe-inspiring Maluti and Drakensberg mountain ranges. Golden Gate Highlands National Park crowns this scenic majesty with its breathtaking sandstone formations and a treasure trove of ancient San rock art, set against a backdrop where wildlife roams free under the vast African sky. Beyond nature’s appeal, the province is a canvas of historical narratives and cultural tapestries. In Bloemfontein, you will discover a hub of knowledge at the National Museum, with its fossil collections unparalleled in South Africa. Memorials and heritage sites tell stories of yesteryear, and the Basotho Cultural Village near Qwaqwa invites you to step into a living history of local traditions. The Free State’s fabric is one of warm hospitality and a relaxed pace of life, offering a slice of tranquillity for the soul.

It is important to distinguish between ‘Grade 12 statement of results’ and ‘Matric Certificate’. USAf does not issue ‘conditional exemption certificates’ based on Grade 11 and mid-year Grade 12 results. Current Grade 12 learners apply for exemption when the final Grade 12 statement of results is available in January. If you meet the exemption requirements with your final Grade 12 ‘statement of results’, USAf will issue a ‘conditional exemption letter’. The actual exemption certificate will only be issued on receipt of a Matric Certificate (available around May). You must be a member of a medical aid registered in terms of the South African Medical Schemes Act, as required by the South African Immigration Act. Your medical aid MUST be valid for the duration of the academic year (until 31 December), renewable each year. No travel insurance, hospital plans, or foreign medical aids will be accepted. The UFS cannot offer financial support (bursaries, loans) to international students. It is therefore important to ensure that you have sufficient financial resources for the planned duration of your studies.

To avoid the stress and anxiety about your finances, you are advised to source and secure funds when you apply for studies at the UFS to support yourself in terms of registration fees, books, meals, accommodation, transport, etc., while you wait for the bursary to pay out. Do not wait until the last minute. The University of the Free State offers the following bursaries for qualifying students: ACADEMIC MERIT AWARDS FOR NEW FIRST-YEAR STUDENTS The UFS offers academic merit awards for first-year students. You have worked very hard and the UFS values and acknowledges your effort. You can use your merit award allocation to register. If your merit award is less than the required registration fee, you will have to pay the balance to finalise your registration. The university reserves the right to amend the regulations and award values and/or conditions applicable to the awarding thereof without prior notice. If you qualify for an academic merit award, we will credit your class fee account with the amount of the award after you register as a student at the University of the Free State.",

This sense of belonging is facilitated through college communities. UFS college communities are created through small pockets or groups that build towards larger communities. We encourage you to become a member of these cohesive groups through on-campus residences or day residences. Together, these groups form the strong building blocks of larger communities called College Communities. College Communities are created by clustering on-campus residences, day residences, and accredited accommodation, which then collaborate with other stakeholders such as faculties, support services, and different Student Affairs departments. The college communities form the social spaces where you can engage in all student-life programmes, e.g., cultural events, sports events, community-service events, dialogues, etc. In a community, we create an opportunity for engagement and communication. We have different student development programmes, such as: • leadership, where you can be a residence committee member and lead your residence on different university platforms; • mentorship, where a support structure is created for first-years’ transition to the university; • arts and culture programmes, which are platforms for students to showcase their different talents; • sport activities: as a Kovsie student, you will continue to enhance your sports talent and if you are committed enough, you can represent Kovsies on national and international level.

Behavioural Economics: Data scientists often work with data that capture aspects of human behaviour and reflect decisions made by investors, consumers, workers, politicians, companies and managers. Behavioural economics investigates how psychological and economic factors affect these decisions. This focal area will equip you with the skills, models and theories to understand, predict and influence human behaviour. Statistical Learning: In almost all environments, decision-making is driven by massive amounts of data, which means that there is a dire need for skilled individuals who can make sense of this data deluge. In general, data science entails the gathering and storage of data, the transformation and graphical representation of data and the analysis of data to make predictions or inferences. The statistical learning focal area entails identifying trends and patterns in data and using these to construct statistical models, which can be used to predict or classify. This is an important task across all industries, meaning that individuals with these particular skills can work on solving real-world problems found in a variety of domains.

SUI Webpage: https://www.sun.ac.za/english/SUinternational 1312 FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS Are percentage uniform marks the same as the Uniform Mark Scale (UMS) used by UK exam boards? Our percentage uniform mark scale uses the same approach as UMS. However, the UMS is not always shown as marks out of 100, whereas our percentage uniform marks are always out of 100. Do percentage uniform marks appear on Cambridge certificates? No. They are published on the statement of results to supplement the grade issued at syllabus level. The key messages for students are: •the percentage uniform mark shows you whether you are in the middle of a grade, or near either the top or the bottom •it does not affect the grade you receive, but gives you more information about it •it will appear on your statement of results but not on your certificate. A GUIDE TO PERCENTAGE UNIFORM MARKS This factsheet is a guide for schools in countries where percentage uniform marks appear on statements of results for Cambridge IGCSE, Cambridge O Level and Cambridge In ternational AS & A Level. Cambridge provides the percentage uniform mark as well as the grade for a syllabus. The percentage uniform mark is not the total mark achieved for the syllabus.",

    "content": "Cambridge In ternational AS & A Level. Cambridge provides the percentage uniform mark as well as the grade for a syllabus. The percentage uniform mark is not the total mark achieved for the syllabus. It is a point on a common scale for all syllabi to show whether the candidate’s performance is close to the top, middle or bottom of the grade. For example, a student who gets the minimum mark necessary for a Grade A* obtains a percentage uniform mark of 90. A student who gets a mark halfway between the Grade D threshold and Grade C threshold achieves a percentage uniform mark of 55. We do not provide a percentage uniform mark when the candidate’s result is Ungraded, No Result, Pending or To Be Issued. The table below shows the percentage uniform marks: Grade Percentage uniform mark range A*90–100 A80–89† B70–79 C60–69 D50–59 E40–49 F (Cambridge IGCSE only)30–39 G (Cambridge IGCSE only)20–29 † In the case of the Cambridge International AS Level qualification, where there is no Grade ‘a*’, the percentage uniform mark range for Grade ‘a’ is 80–100 The percentage uniform mark is stated at syllabus level only. It is not the same as the actual total mark that the candidate achieves on the syllabus. This is because the percentage uniform mark depends on both the actual total mark for the syllabus and the position of the grade thresholds (which may vary from one exam series to another and from one syllabus to another). The percentage uniform mark is also different from the actual mark because it is always calculated out of 100. 1514 QUESTIONS ABOUT CAMBRIDGE CURRICULUM?

    "content": "- G AND 9-1 GRADES Cambridge IGCSE is graded A* - G, Cambridge O level is graded A* - E. Both grade sets are well established, widely used systems that universities, parents and schools know to trust. In August 2017, some GCSE results in England will be reported on a different, 9-1 grading scale. On this scale, 9 is the top grade. UK GCSEs and Cambridge IGCSEs have been reported on an A* - G grading scale for almost 30 years and offer a good level of differentiation between students’ performance. The grading scale is understood and accepted by universities and employers around the world. WILL CAMBRIDGE CONTINUE TO USE A* - G GRADING? y Yes. We asked Cambridge schools worldwide for their views on our grading scale. y Most of our schools have chosen to retain the A* - G grades, because they are so well understood. y We will continue to consult with Cambridge schools. HOW DO A*-G GRADES COMPARE TO 9-1 GRADES? A* - G grades9-1 grades A*9 A8 7 Anchor Point B6 5 C4 Anchor Point D3 E2 F1 G Anchor Point UU A* - G GRADE FACTS AND FIGURES y Our A* - G grading is used in over 145 countries in over 6000 schools around the world y Over 800 000 Cambridge IGCSEs are awarded A* - grades by Cambridge every year y All students in England taking GCSEs in 2017 will receive A* - G grades in all but three subjects WILL STUDENTS OUTSIDE ENGLAND RECEIVE 9-1 GCSE GRADES? Wales, Scotland and Northern Island are not adopting 9-1 grading. Some other exam boards offering international GCSEs plan to introduce 9-1 grades. WILL STUDENTS APPLYING TO UNIVERSITY WITH A*- G GRADED IGCSES BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY TO STUDENTS WITH 9-1 GRADES? y No, universities have made it clear that they will treat students with 9-1 grades and students with A* - G grades equally. y Some UK universities require a C grade at GCSE in Maths and English. Under the 9-1 grading system some universities will use the new grade 5 as an equivalent while other will use grade 4.",

DISADVANTAGE FACTOR This is a percentage, from 0 to 10%, by which we adjust the FPS of South African, NSC candidates to arrive at the WPS. The disadvantage factor is in turn derived from factors related to the disadvantage experienced by applicants in their school and at home. EARLY CONDITIONAL OFFER This is an offer of admission, made during the course of the year preceding admission, which is conditional on performance in your final secondary school examinations. Early conditional offers are not made to all applicants. An early conditional offer will be withdrawn if the conditions for admission are not met. FACULTY POINTS SCORE (FPS) This is the score we use to rank applicants. In two faculties, Health Sciences and Science, the APS is adapted to calculate the FPS. In the other faculties, the APS equals the FPS. FACULTY A faculty is a grouping of departments that offers specific degree, diploma and certificate programmes. There are six faculties at UCT. Students register in a faculty.

These are necessary requirements you must meet, but are not necessarily sufficient for entry. NATIONAL BENCHMARK TESTS (NBTS) Most undergraduate applicants who normally reside, or have completed/are completing schooling, in South Africa must write the NBTs. Applicants applying for admission to a programme in the Faculty of Health Sciences, excluding and the Advanced Diploma in Cosmetic Formulation Science, and all applicants to the undergraduate LLB programme must write the NBTs, wherever they may reside. NATIONAL SENIOR CERTIFICATE (NSC) Since 2008, South African school-leavers write the NSC examinations. This may be under the auspices of one of three examining authorities: The Department of Basic Education (DBE), the Independent Examinations Board (IEB) or the South African Comprehensive Assessment Institute (SACAI). Scores in this prospectus are calculated for NSC applicants. PROGRAMME Students enter a degree, diploma or certificate programme, which is a combination of subjects that have been constructed to provide you with a particular knowledge and skills base, and leads to a qualification. REDRESS CATEGORY The redress category is derived, for South African applicants only, from the racial classification of their parents during Apartheid. REGISTRATION If you are offered a study place, you must register as a student before the start of the first term. We call this registration. Registration gives you a student status, commits you to a certain programme, and commits you to pay fees for it.

PAGES NO NEED TO ALL BE CHANGE STILL APPLICATION & ADMISSION TO UCT ADMISSIONS POLICY Our admissions policy is designed to ensure that top achievers are offered places at UCT, and to ensure a diverse student body by incorporating measures for redress and measures to ensure that the incoming cohort increasingly reflects the demographic diversity of our country. We start by: • setting minimum levels of academic achievement for each programme, below which we will not offer a place; • setting the class size for each programme and • setting an aspirational demographic enrolment target for each programme; and determining selection methods. THE FACULTY POINTS SCORE The Faculty Points Score (FPS) (calculated in different ways to meet the needs of each faculty) is used to rank applicants; a small number of the best applicants will be offered places on the basis of the FPS. REDRESS ON THE BASIS OF DISADVANTAGE As our South African history has been, and in many cases continues to be, one of gross inequality usually structured along racial lines, a key element of our admissions policy is to provide for redress for South African citizens and permanent residents on the basis of disadvantage. To do this we look at the school the applicant attends/attended and their family background.",

This yields a disadvantage factor, expressed as a percentage from 0% to 10% (or for the programmes in the Faculty of Health Sciences, from 0% to 20%). We add this percentage of the FPS to the FPS to derive the weighted Faculty Point Score (WPS). For more information visit Disadvantage Factor Calculator. In other words, if the disadvantage factor is 7%, we calculate the WPS as follows: WPS = FPS + (7% X FPS). If there is a zero redress factor (no school or family disadvantage or an international applicant) then the factor is 0% and WPS = FPS + 0 = FPS. REDRESS FOR DIVERSITY We categorise all South African applicants (not international applicants) according to the categorisation of their parents’ race under apartheid. This allows us to have a proxy for the applicant’s disadvantage. We use these categories to give priority in making selection decisions to ensure that we meet the diversity targets we set for each programme/plan. These are the four designated redress categories used to give effect to our admissions policy. Redress category 1: An applicant with at least one parent classified as Black under apartheid Redress category 2: An applicant with at least one parent classified as Coloured (and the other not as Black) under apartheid Redress category 3: An applicant with at least one parent classified as Indian (and the other not as Black or Coloured) under apartheid Redress category 4: An applicant with at least one parent classified as Chinese (and the other not as Black, Coloured or Indian) under apartheid SELECTION METHODS When making offers, we: • select a proportion of the programme/plan using the unweighted FPS; this we call Band A.",

WHAT IS THE APPLICATION FEE? South African and SADC applicants must pay a non-refundable application fee of R100. Other international applicants are required to pay an application fee of R300. Application fees will not be refunded under any circumstances. Paying your application fee does not mean you will be offered a place to study at UCT. The application fee may be paid by direct deposit, electronic funds transfer (EFT) or credit card. Cash payments may only be made at the Cashiers Office, Kramer Building, Cross Campus Road, Middle Campus, UCT. Credit card payments must be made online at payments.uct.ac.za/admissions/ . Currently registered UCT students, UCT graduates and Semester Study Abroad applicants do not pay an application fee. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED? You will get an email acknowledgement setting out what you have to do next. If you apply by completing a paper application form, and you do not have an email address, we will write to you, acknowledging receipt and asking you to check the data we have captured from your form.

Conditional offers will only be confirmed once the final FPS and NBT results are available, and provided both the FPS and NBT results confirm that the admission criteria have been satisfied. For applicants doing international secondary school leaving qualifications, we typically require all possible submissions before final secondary school leaving results are available. Examples of important submissions to support conditional offers are predicted scores, IGCSE results and SAT results. SCORE CALCULATIONS FOR NATIONAL SENIOR CERTIFICATE (NSC) APPLICANTS ONLY For applicants writing the NSC we use an Admission Points Score (APS), a Faculty Points Score (FPS) and, in the case of South African applicants, a Weighted Points Score (WPS) to assess your performance at school. The scores are described in detail on the next pages. The percentages achieved in NSC examinations (preliminary and final examinations) will be allocated an admissions score equal to that percentage. To calculate your APS (a score out of a maximum of 600), add English and the five best other subjects percentages, excluding Life Orientation and scores for AP subjects, but including any other required subject(s) for the relevant programme. (In other words, for a programme where Mathematics and Physical Sciences are required, take the scores for English, Mathematics, Physical Sciences and the next best three subjects other than Life Orientation and AP subjects to calculate your APS.) Results below 40% for any subject do not attract a score. In order to determine which subjects are required for admission to particular programmes, refer to the faculty sections that follow.

Information regarding the use of the test scores in each faculty can be found in the faculty pages. WHAT ARE THE NATIONAL BENCHMARK TESTS? The NBTs are three multiple-choice tests written as a combined Academic Literacy and Quantitative Literacy test and a separate Mathematics test. The Academic and Quantitative Literacy Test (AQL) is a three-hour test which consists of an Academic and a Quantitative Literacy (QL) section. The results of the two sections of the test are reported separately. The Academic Literacy (AL) Test tests your capacity to engage successfully with the demands of academic study in the language of instruction which is English at UCT. The Quantitative Literacy (QL) Test targets your ability to manage situations or solve problems in a real context that is relevant to higher education study, using basic quantitative information that may be presented verbally, graphically, in tabular or symbolic form. The Mathematics Test is a three-hour test which targets a writer’s ability related to mathematical concepts formally regarded as part of the secondary school curriculum relevant for Higher Education studies. WHO WRITES WHAT? Applicants to the Faculties of Humanities, Commerce and Law write the Academic and Quantitative Literacy test only. Applicants to Health Sciences, Science and Engineering write the Academic and Quantitative Literacy test as well as the Mathematics test. The completion of the Mathematics syllabus is not a prerequisite for writing the Mathematics Test. REGISTERING FOR YOUR NATIONAL BENCHMARK TESTS Write the NBTs as early as possible in 2025.

Persons with disabilities must tick the box that indicates that they have a disability. They will then be advised to email nbt@uct.ac.za so that they can be contacted for discussions around the reasonable accommodations required. The final date to write the NBTs for admission to UCT is 4 October 2025. If you wish to be considered for a conditional offer by the Faculty of Health Sciences, you must write the NBTs by 31 July 2025; if you write the NBTs after 31 July, you will only be considered for an offer in early 2026 after the final NSC examination results are received. In summary, our advice to you is to: • write the NBTs on the day for which you registered, as you are liable for the fees regardless of whether you write or not • rewrite the NBTs if you wish to improve your results. Whether you write once or twice, your results for tests written after 4 October 2025 may not be considered at UCT. HOW ARE THE TEST RESULTS USED? The test results are used in addition to secondary school- leaving academic performance and do not replace the use of school-leaving results. In the case of applications to the Faculty of Health Sciences, the National Benchmark Test results make up a specific proportion of an applicant’s overall Faculty Points Score.

In the first year of undergraduate studies, you may choose to move from one degree to another, changing specialisations as you understand more about the disciplines. WHAT WE OFFER The Faculty of Commerce offers two undergraduate degrees, the three year Bachelor of Commerce and the four year Bachelor of Business Science. BACHELOR OF BUSINESS SCIENCE (BBUSSC) & BACHELOR OF COMMERCE (BCOM) Entry requirements are the same for both degrees. Each degree offers a variety of specialisations to cater both for the interests of our students and employment needs. Both degrees are highly marketable. The first year of the BBus Sc and the BCom share several common courses in the subject areas of Accounting, Information Systems, Economics, Business Law, Mathematics, Statistics, Evidence-based Management and Business Ethics. The BBus Sc curriculum teaches the science of business within a field of specialisation. This includes subjects such as People Management, Business Ethics and Strategic Thinking. On the other hand, the BCom curriculum prepares students for a specific field of specialisation. As more material is covered in a BBus Sc, the degree takes four years to complete, while a BCom takes three. The Academic Development Programme (ADP) BBus Sc can be taken over a four- or five-year period, and the ADP BCom over a three- or four-year period through the Commerce Education Development Unit (EDU). In the EDU, students receive a range of additional support. You can find out more about the EDU below.

APPLICANTS WITH DISABILITIES UCT welcomes applications from applicants with special needs. However, there are some disabilities that would prevent someone from completing a particular health sciences curriculum (for example, someone who is deaf may not be able to hear a heartbeat through a stethoscope). For this reason, applicants with disabilities are urged to communicate with the Faculty, via UCT’s Disability Service, to establish whether this would apply to them. The Faculty reserves the right to require an applicant (or an admitted student) to undergo a professional assessment to determine the extent and likely impact of a disability on his or her ability to meet the requirements of the curriculum, including such practical training and practice as is required in the health sciences discipline concerned. UCT reserves the right to withdraw an offer to an applicant or cancel the registration of a student who has failed to declare a disability that is found to be such as to make it impossible for him or her to meet the curriculum requirements in the health sciences discipline concerned. THE SELECTION PROCESS The Faculty of Health Sciences Admissions committee will prioritize first choice applicants during the selection process. Applicants compete in selection categories as follows: • South African secondary school leavers • SADC applicants (international applicants) • Applicants with tertiary results from UCT or other institutions. The Dean may also allocate (within the intake targets) a small number of discretionary places, on merit, to (for example) the following categories of applicants: • Repeat applicants who meet the prescribe minimum criteria • Applicants with disabilities.",

CONDITIONAL OFFERS In the case of secondary school-leavers, conditional offers are first made to applicants with very competitive results. The condition on which early offers are made is that applicants maintain or improve, in their final examinations, their best level of performance to date, at the time that the offer was made (Should applicants not meet the conditions in their final examinations, their conditional offer may be revoked). If you are studying at, or completed studies at, another higher education institution, you will be considered on the basis of your secondary school-leaving results and your higher education results. In addition, transferring applicants may be required to write the National Benchmark Tests as indicated (see ), and may be asked to submit a letter of motivation. You will need to submit an interim academic transcript, certificate of good conduct and your final, year- end transcript as soon as they are available and no later than 31 December 2025. Applicants who do not secure early conditional offers are reconsidered when the final secondary school results are received. The cut-off points for offers may then be dropped until the class is filled.

The APS is worked out as follows: percentages of three required subjects plus percentages of next three best subjects excluding Life Orientation. NBT = National Benchmark Tests (score out of 300). The results are published in Proficient/Intermediate /Basic ranges. FPS = The Faculty Points Score (FPS) (score out of 900). This consists of the percentages of three required subjects plus percentages of next three best subjects but excluding Life Orientation, plus the NBT score. WPS = Weighted Points Score (score out of 1080). The WPS is used in Band B only and consists of your FPS weighted by your disadvantage factor (see the section on the general Admissions Policy for an explanation of the disadvantage factors). 40 NATIONAL BENCHMARK TESTS All secondary school leaving applicants must write some or all components of the NBTs, consisting of the Academic and Quantitative Literacy Test (AQL) and Mathematics Test. NBT results contribute up to 300 points towards your Faculty Points Score.

The Bachelor of Arts (BA) and Bachelor of Social Science (BSoc Sc) degrees offer a flexible structure in which students can choose their own courses from a wide selection, following certain rules over the three years of the degree, and ending up with a specialisation in two or more subjects. These specialisations are known as course majors. The full list of available Arts and Social Science majors is set out in the above table. Humanities students may select courses from other faculties as a second major, but must have at least one major offered by departments established in the Faculty of Humanities.

The 65% GPA is the minimum requirement for candidates to be eligible for consideration for a place on a competitive basis. It does not guarantee a place. Given the large number of candidates who apply for the law major and the fact that places are limited and are offered on a competitive basis to candidates with the highest GPA, it is likely that a candidate will require a GPA well above 65% in order to actually receive a place. Results in supplementary examinations are not included when calculating the first-year average but the results of deferred examinations are included. Please note that the Law Faculty retains the discretion to admit Humanities students with an average of less than 65% on redress grounds.

The NBT scores are used to complement the Faculty Point Score (FPS) in making admissions decisions. As the NBT assesses entry-level academic proficiency, an applicant with a Lower Intermediate or Basic score on the Academic Literacy (AL) portion of the NBT will not normally be considered for admission to degree studies in the Faculty of Humanities. The results of the Quantitative Literacy (QL) section are usually only used for entry into Humanities degrees that have Psychology or any other course which has quantitative requirements as part of the curriculum. The NBT test is also used as a placement indicator to identify applicants in need of language development courses, or other additional academic support; and as an indicator, along with the FPS, of eligibility for an early offer or an Entrance Scholarship.

FACULTY OF LAW 58 FACULTY OF LAW WHY STUDY LAW? Students who wish to become legal practitioners require an LLB (Bachelor of Laws) degree. An LLB is the universal general qualification for the practice of law, although the content of the LLB programme differs from country to country. During the course of the LLB degree students are taught the fundamentals of South African law and the South African legal system. At the same time, they are equipped with the skills necessary to be successful legal practitioners. 58 | 2026 UNDERGRADUATE PROSPECTUS SOME OF THE SKILLS THE UCT LLB STRIVES TO IMPART ARE: The ability to read, comprehend, and critically evaluate complex documents, including cases and legislation; the ability to write clearly, logically, coherently, and succinctly; and the ability to analyse and solve problems.",

CAREER OPPORTUNITIES LLB graduates are employed in the legal profession and in a wide variety of positions in the judiciary, government, NGOs, companies and other enterprises. Academic An LLB degree is the first step to an academic career. UCT’s Master of Laws and Postgraduate Diploma programmes offer a very broad range of postgraduate courses from which to select a specialisation. ADVOCATE LLB graduates undergo one year’s training in pupillage with a practising member of the Bar. After an admission examination, the work of an advocate generally involves research, drafting opinions and pleadings, and presenting cases in court, most often though not exclusively in the High Court. Advocates must be briefed or instructed by attorneys; they do not take instructions directly from members of the public. Obtaining the LLB does not automatically entitle non-citizens and non-permanent residents of South Africa to be admitted to practise in this country. ATTORNEYS An LLB graduate must serve as a candidate attorney with a practising attorney and then write a professional examination set by the relevant provincial law society to become an attorney. Attorneys’ work includes drafting legal documents, negotiating settlements of disputes, and preparing cases for presentation in court. Attorneys take instructions from members of the public and, if necessary, may brief or seek an opinion from an advocate.",

BUSINESS Law graduates are to be found across the whole business spectrum, from small firms to large corporations. They are legal advisors in tax, real estate, labour relations, contracts, public information, and acquisitions; they are forensic auditors and ombudsmen, ethics and employment officers, and policy and legislative analysts. Publishing firms look for legal editors, researchers, and writers. GOVERNMENT The Department of Justice employs state attorneys, prosecutors, legal drafters and of course magistrates and judges. Law graduates interested in international law can join the Department of Foreign Affairs or Department of Trade and Industry. Other government departments at both national and provincial levels employ lawyers, as do the National Parliament, provincial legislatures and municipal councils. In fact, there is no sector of government in which lawyers do not play a role! NGOS AND PUBLIC BENEFIT ORGANISATIONS Researchers and lobbyists are in demand and many law graduates who are committed to the transformation of South African society work in such organisations.

However, the legal education offered by each route is identical i.e. there is no difference between the routes as far as the law courses are concerned, and each of the routes leads to the same endpoint, the award of an LLB degree. In choosing between the different routes, it may be helpful for you to consider how well prepared you are for university studies (i.e. how serious you are about studying law now, amongst other things) and the amount of higher education you wish to receive in addition to a legal education. The best approach in choosing your route is to be realistic about your current ability to deal with a large workload and lots of reading. In addition, ask yourself whether you prefer to enter training for a professional qualification immediately or whether you are interested in other disciplines too. THE DIFFERENT ROUTES EXPLAINED The undergraduate LLB (4 years minimum) The undergraduate LLB is aimed at candidates who do not already hold a university degree. Most candidates are school leavers. The admission requirements for this degree are high. This is because all three LLB streams are taught together in the same class and school leavers must be able to manage the workload. As the description indicates, this route can be completed in four years, but as a result only a limited number of non-law courses can be fitted into the curriculum. THE COMBINED HUMANITIES/COMMERCE LLB (5 YEARS MINIMUM) The combined Law and Humanities or Law and Commerce route allows candidates to do what is described as an accelerated combined Humanities/Commerce and LLB degree.",

This means that students receive two degrees by the end of their combined programme; a bachelor’s degree in the Humanities or Commerce faculty (BA/BSoc Sci or BCom) which is awarded at the end of their first three years of study, and a bachelor’s degree in law (LLB), which is awarded at the end of a further two years of study. It is also possible to do a combined BBus Sci LLB programme which requires at least 6 years of study. At the end of their Humanities/ Commerce degrees, students will graduate with a degree in which they have a major in a commerce or humanities subject and a major in law. Please note that students must apply for admission to the Law Faculty at the end of their undergraduate Humanities or Commerce degree and must obtain a cumulative GPA of at least 60% in their UCT undergraduate degree in order to proceed to the two-year graduate LLB degree. This route allows candidates who do not meet the requirements for admission to the undergraduate LLB to apply for a Humanities or Commerce degree, to adapt to university studies, and, if they perform satisfactorily in their first year of study, to join the law stream in their second or third year at university. The advantage of this route over the undergraduate LLB route is that a full major in a discipline other than law is possible, thus resulting in a more rounded higher education experience. THE GRADUATE LLB (3 YEARS MINIMUM) The graduate LLB route is for students who have completed an undergraduate degree in any discipline without having majored in law. This route allows candidates to complete a full degree in a discipline other than law and then add the LLB. This route can be completed in a minimum of six years (3 + 3).",

It does not guarantee a place. Given the large number of candidates who apply for the law major and the fact that places are limited and are offered on a competitive basis to candidates with the highest GPAs, it is likely that a candidate will require a GPA well above 65% or 63% in order to actually receive a place. The Law Faculty retains a discretion to admit Humanities students with an average of less than 65% and Commerce students with an average of less than 63% to meet redress category targets. Once students have completed their Hu - manities or Commerce degrees with law subjects, they must apply to the Law Faculty for admission to the 2-year graduate LLB degree. Applicants for the 2-year graduate LLB are considered and offered places on a competitive basis taking into account the UCT’s ad - missions policy. However, UCT applicants who achieve a cumulative average of at least 60% in their undergrad - uate degree are guaranteed admission to the LLB. ADMISSION TO THE GRADUATE LLB Applicants must obtain an average of at least 65% in a standard undergraduate degree to be considered for possible admission to the graduate LLB. This average is calculated from your results over of all years of your undergraduate degree. Places are however limited and are allocated to applicants with the highest averages on a competitive basis and in accordance with the University’s admissions policy. Given the large number of applicants and the limited number of places, it is likely that applicants will require a higher GPA to actually receive place.

The world’s oceans cover 71% of the surface of the planet, and have a mean depth of 3 800m, meaning that they make up well over 95% of the ‘living space’ on earth. They are also the least known of the environments on earth; indeed, an estimated half of all marine species have yet to be discovered! Cape Town is one of the best locations in the world to study marine biology, as it is situated at the confluence of three of the world’s major oceans – the Atlantic, Indian and Southern Oceans. Students taking this major will learn about the diversity of marine life in all its forms and about the structure and function of various marine ecosystems, ranging from coral reefs to polar seas and from estuaries to the abyssal depths. Students also learn about management and conservation of marine resources, a field that provides the most employment opportunities for marine biologists.

Aspects of currents and water masses in the oceans of the world and coastal oceanography around South Africa provide the focus of regional oceanography. Located in the subtropics, South Africa experiences both tropical and mid-latitude influences on its weather, climate and oceanic environments. The Ocean and Atmosphere Science major deals with the circulation and properties of the global ocean, their regional variations, and how the ocean interacts with the atmosphere to produce the various marine and atmospheric environments we experience. A fundamental knowledge of Ocean and Atmosphere Science is necessary for understanding the distributions of the various marine and terrestrial ecosystems, climate change and variability, severe weather such as tropical cyclones and thunderstorms, as well as the properties of the world oceans. The trans-disciplinary skills developed in this major offers graduates opportunities to branch out into many other areas of Earth System Science or to specialise in a field of Oceanography, Atmospheric Science or Climate up to a Ph D level. UCT is ideally placed to offer such a major given our proximity to the world’s strongest western boundary current (the Agulhas), a cold upwelling current system (the Benguela) and the highly dynamic Southern Ocean. Visit www.sea.uct.ac.za PHYSICS Physics is about understanding the nature of matter and radiation in the language of mathematics, and as such is a central fundamental discipline in science. A major in physics teaches you how to apply your knowledge of fundamental principles in a range of contexts. Applications of the principles of physics are everywhere: transistors, computers, optical fibres, quantum computing. Physicists discovered the structure of DNA and the genetic code, and invented X-ray machines and the World Wide Web. Visit www.phy.uct.ac.",

It is important that your visa is endorsed specifically for study at UCT. If you hold refugee or asylum seeker status issued by the South African Government you are exempt from needing a study visa to attend UCT, however, you are required to produce a valid South African Government issued refugee or asylum seeker permit. The offer of a study place by UCT does not bind the Department of Home Affairs in any way to allow you to study in South Africa, nor does it remove the need for you to obtain permission to enter the country. If you are offered a study place, please apply immediately for a study visa. You can apply for a study visa with a conditional study place offer or a firm study place offer. Your application must be made to the nearest South African Embassy, Consulate or High Commission in your home country. This procedure could take from 8 to 12 weeks or longer to be processed, so apply without delay. Please review the website for the South African Embassy/ Mission or Consular Office for the country where the application will be made regarding ALL visa application requirements and operations.

This is even more important if you are meeting the cost of studying yourself, or if you are studying away from home. When your personal expenses, accommodation and travel are included, a single year at UCT can cost over R126 000. A significant number of students fund their studies through a combination of scholarships, bursaries (either administered by UCT or by organisations outside UCT), loans, help from parents, sponsorship by companies, and through part-time and vacation work. There are many kinds of financial support available to South African students: entrance scholarships; sports scholarships; bursaries, loans and financial assistance packages. We encourage you to explore all of these possibilities. For instance, although you may obtain an entrance or sports scholarship from UCT, you can still apply for other funding. APPLYING FOR FINANCIAL AID As of 1 August 2016, the National Student Financial Aid Scheme (NSFAS) opened its student-centred application model. First-time applications for financial aid, as well as funding renewal for those students who are already recipients of NSFAS funding, will be handled centrally via NSFAS. Although applicants may have applied to multiple institutions for admission to study, only one financial aid application directly to NSFAS will be required. All students and learners who need financial assistance should apply to NSFAS via the latter’s online application system. It is important to check the NSFAS website and their social media for details of when applications open and close for submission of applications. Ensure that your application is submitted before the closing date. If you think you may need to be assisted financially, our advice is to submit a completed financial aid application to NSFAS, since late applications will not be accepted. In addition, you can apply to other sponsors and funders.",

Persons with disabilities can apply for the NSFAS Disability Grant which has a higher income cap as it takes into consideration (when applicable) the possible costs of assistive devices, human support and medical practitioners. When applying for NSFAS on the website, select the disability box and remember to have the Annexure A form filled in and stamped by your medical practitioner. Scan and upload your completed Annexure A form along with your medical documents to be considered for the grant. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR SCHOOL-LEAVERS Each year, UCT allocates over R8 million as entrance scholarships to school-leavers who are coming to study at UCT for the first time. South African citizens and permanent residents are eligible for these awards. The awards range from R20 000 to R100 000. No application for a UCT entrance scholarship is necessary. Entrance scholarships are for the first year after which students are eligible for consideration for a faculty scholarship. Each faculty specifies academic criteria that you need to meet in order to be eligible for a faculty scholarship in subsequent years. UCT’s entrance scholarships are for students who show academic potential. Entrance scholarship offers are based on considerations of how UCT wishes to constitute its new undergraduate class.",

An ECP can be regarded as a somewhat longer (usually up to a year longer), but safer and more supported route to qualifying for a degree. In fact, many students not on ECPs take longer anyway to complete their degrees because of failing some of their courses and being unable to continue. Failure could be avoided by following an ECP instead. Each Faculty at UCT has its own ADP unit, and the faculty- based ECPs are fully integrated with later years of study in the Faculty.",

Nelson R. Mandela School of Medicine The Medical School has been producing quality doctors since 1950. Founded as a ‘black school’ in a ‘white institution’, for most of its history, the School has been synonymous with the struggle for democracy and racial equality. On its 50th anniversary in 2000, the Medical School received the finest birthday present it could have wished for – the agreement of former president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, Nelson Mandela, to link his name to the School. Launched in July 2003, it is training a new generation of clinical researchers, enhancing the clinical research infrastructure in Kwa Zulu-Natal and fostering collaborations between research groups working on similar projects in South Africa and other countries. Pietermaritzburg Pietermaritzburg is located in the Kwa Zulu-Natal Midlands, close to numerous nature reserves and parks. It is one hour’s drive from Durban and two hours’ drive from the u Khahlamba-Drakensberg Park. The city has a rich architectural heritage, with many examples of Victorian and Edwardian buildings. The city is the birthplace of the former University of Natal and its forerunner, the Natal University College, which opened its doors to 57 students in 1910.

Leaders in Curriculum Development UKZN has taken a leading role in curriculum development, recognising worldwide trends and the restructuring of the South African educational system towards a more ‘outcome-based’ approach. Many of the challenges students will face in their future professional life cannot be solved by a single discipline. UKZN has redesigned its curricula to include large elements of inter-disciplinary work. In this way, students will be exposed to a wider range of disciplines, thus widening their choice of career options, and enhancing their understanding of the society in which they will live and work. The new curricula are arranged into modules that will give them more flexibility in the composition of their degree package. This will also give them the freedom to interrupt and resume their studies, depending on their financial circumstances.",

UNDERGRADUATE PROSPECTUS 2025UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL 2627 Selection Procedure • Selection is done in terms of academic ranking. The maximum APS obtainable is 48. Selection will therefore start from 48 down and will stop once places in a programme have been filled. • The minimum APS’s published should therefore only be used as a guide. • Meeting the minimum score does not guarantee a place, as the University receives more applications than it can accommodate and places in a programme may be filled before the published score is reached. Aim for scores above the minimum published. • Applications below the published scores will not be offered places. • Applicants must calculate their minimum score, using Grade 11, mid-year Grade 12 or Trial results and only apply if they think that they will meet the requirements. • Applicants must pay attention to school quintile requirements for extended programmes. Early Selection • Applicants with excellent Grade 11, Grade 12 June/Trial or mock results may be selected early (before final examinations). Selections will be final, provided selected applicants obtain a NSC-Deg or equivalent and meet qualification entrance requirements and academic ranking in the final examinations. • Applicants already in possession of a NSC-Deg or Senior Certificate may also be offered places early.",

It is imperative that students familiarise themselves with the contents thereof. • Teaching and class attendance: Teaching is carried out in various forms such as lectures, seminars, group assignments, laboratory work and individual study. Students are encouraged to actively participate in class discussions. Attendance of lectures is compulsory, and discipline and responsibility for one’s own workload is encouraged. A great deal of time is spent on course literature and students may be referred to texts available in the libraries. In some courses, students are required to present papers, either individually or in collaboration with fellow students, at a seminar and full participation in discussions in class is encouraged. • Marks and grades: Marks and grades for both undergraduate and postgraduate levels vary considerably between courses. Every course requires full-time study equivalents to its number of points. All courses include written assignments, tests and a final examination. Grades are awarded as percentages, e.g.: • Transfer of credits: One full credit per module/class at UKZN is 16 credits. Full-time (undergraduate) local and international students are required to register for a total of 64 course credits per semester. A 64-course credits registration makes up a full semester load. • Accreditation at international institutions may differ. For more information, students must contact the College Admissions Office where they are registered.",

The SRC represents students in all University matters as individuals or as a body, and serves the student body to fight for student rights by striving for a just standard of general welfare and services for all students (regardless of race, sex, colour and creed) and further facilitates communication between students and other stakeholders within the University, and the higher education sector.

It is further represented in the highest decision- making body of the University, Council, and the academic decision-making body, the Senate.

If students are absent from a tutorial, a test or a laboratory session, they should submit proof of the reason for their absence. If they are ill, they may require a doctor’s certificate. Assessment • Previously, student work was assessed by means of semester examinations. This is now changing to a mix of end of semester exams and continuous assessment or ‘class marks’ made up of assessed tasks completed during the semester. • If a student fails an exam with a mark between 40-48%, the student is usually given the chance to write a supplementary examination for which there is an extra fee per course. • Some modules (such as the core modules) have done away with end of semester examinations. Tests are written under examination conditions during the semester. Those who pass the assessment do not have to sit the examination. • Class marks in all modules are important.

UNDERGRADUATE PROSPECTUS 2025UNIVERSITY OF KWAZULU-NATAL 8485 Agricultural (Bioresources) Engineering Bioresources engineers connect the living world of plants, soil, water and animals with the technology of engineering, i.e. systems, structures and machines. They design and build machines, structures and systems for the production and processing of biological resources and work at the cutting edge of technology and the environment and in a variety of areas such as water resource management, forestry, mining rehabilitation, machinery design, management, food processing and ecology. If working with living and life-giving things appeals to students, then they should consider a career in Bioresources Engineering. Computer Engineering Computer engineers design and manage computer systems from small Local Area Networks (LANs) to networks that span the world via cables, optical fibres and radio and satellite links. Computer networks are the backbone on which our economy is based. Computer Engineering is a rapidly expanding field.

Programmes Offered in Law Undergraduate and postgraduate courses are run by dedicated staff members who are specialists in their own particular fields. Staff members are rich in practical experience and therefore, in addition to providing students with critical knowledge and understanding of the law, also provide insight into the many practical aspects of legal practice. The School of Law has a long established and highly respected Moot Court Programme in which all students must argue a point of law. The entire process, including the research, preparation and presentation, is conducted as if the students were arguing an appeal before the High Court or the Supreme Court of Appeal. Preliminary rounds are judged by members of staff, and after the semi- final, the best students proceed to the final, which is judged by three judges of the High Court. The final is a premier event for Law students and is attended by members of the legal profession, University management, staff and students, donors and visitors from other universities and institutions. The Moot Court Programme, together with visits to local law courts, exposes students to some of the realities of the law in practice.

The university’s development as a crucial place in Johannesburg, part of its fabric, has been an organic one, allowing Wits’s taff, students and communities to navigate their way creatively across disciplines and campuses. The origins of Wits lie in the South African School of Mines, which was established in Kimberley in 1896 and transferred to Johannesburg as the Transvaal Technical Institute in 1904. It became the Transvaal University College in 1906 and was renamed the South African School of Mines and Technology four years l ate r. Other departments were added as Johannesburg grew and in 1920 the name was changed to the University College, Johannesburg. Full university status was granted in 1922, incorporating the College as the University of the Witwatersrand, with effect from the first of March that year. Seven months later the inauguration of the university was duly celebrated. Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor-general of the Union of SA, became the university’s first chancellor, and Professor Jan H Hofmeyr its first principal. Building began at Milner Park on a site donated to the university by the Johannesburg municipality. In the early days, Wits also operated from Eloff Street in the city centre and gradually moved to its first completed teaching buildings, the Botany and Zoology block, housing the departments of Geology, Botany, Zoology and Applied Mathematics at Milner Park in 1923.",

The Wedge, a building formerly owned by the National Institute of Metallurgy, was taken over by Wits in 1979. The Milner Park showgrounds were acquired in 1984 from the Witwatersrand Agricultural Society and renamed West Campus. Today, the campuses range across some 400ha. In 1989, the Chamber of Mines Building for the Faculty of Engineering on the West Campus was opened and the brick-paved AMIC deck was built across the M1 motorway to link the east and west campuses. The university’s interests have not been confined to development and expansion at Milner Park and adjacent areas. In the 1960s, the university acquired the Sterkfontein farm, with its world-famous limestone caves rich in archaeological material. In 1968, the neighbouring farm, Swartkrans, was purchased . In contrast to its Johannesburg campuses, the Wits Rural Campus is surrounded by wide-open spaces where herds of antelope roam beneath marula trees. Located near Bushbuckridge on the border of Limpopo, Mpumalanga and Mozambique, the campus was established in the 1980s in response to the critique that Wits was essentially an urban university. At the time, Professor John Gear argued that “rural and urban are two sides of the same coin. The fate of one impacts the other.” The WRC is truly interdisciplinary, serving as a base that enables Wits researchers and students from a range of disciplines to engage with rural issues in a wider context. The rural campus has been hailed as an exemplar of what universities need to do to transform society –bridging the gap between poor and rich, rural and urban, local and international. Wits University’s Great Hall in Braamfontein has been the centre of learning for thousands of students. administrative offices of the Faculty of Medicine moved to a new building in Esselen Street, Hillbrow, in 1964.

The university is cognisant that it must continue to promote freedom of enquiry and the search for knowledge and truth, foster a culturally diverse, intellectually stimulating and harmonious environment within which there is vigorous critical exchange and communication, and encourage freedom of speech and public debate, through facilitating dialogue and interaction between different parties, with the goal of increasing mutual respect and trust.

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account. Witsies are changing the world in all spheres – Rory Byrne served as the chief engineer for Ferrari, John Burland saved the leaning tower of Pisa from falling, and Professor Bavesh Kana is helping to make the testing for tuberculosis more accurate.

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account. Witsies are changing the world in all spheres – Rory Byrne served as the chief engineer for Ferrari, John Burland saved the leaning tower of Pisa from falling, and Professor Bavesh Kana is helping to make the testing for tuberculosis more accurate.

The university’s development as a crucial place in Johannesburg, part of its fabric, has been an organic one, allowing Wits’s taff, students and communities to navigate their way creatively across disciplines and campuses. The origins of Wits lie in the South African School of Mines, which was established in Kimberley in 1896 and transferred to Johannesburg as the Transvaal Technical Institute in 1904. It became the Transvaal University College in 1906 and was renamed the South African School of Mines and Technology four years l ate r. Other departments were added as Johannesburg grew and in 1920 the name was changed to the University College, Johannesburg.",

Prince Arthur of Connaught, governor-general of the Union of SA, became the university’s first chancellor, and Professor Jan H Hofmeyr its first principal. Building began at Milner Park on a site donated to the university by the Johannesburg municipality. In the early days, Wits also operated from Eloff Street in the city centre and gradually moved to its first completed teaching buildings, the Botany and Zoology block, housing the departments of Geology, Botany, Zoology and Applied Mathematics at Milner Park in 1923. The university had at that stage six faculties (Arts, Science, Medicine, Engineering, Law and Commerce), 37 departments, 73 members of academic staff and just over 1,000 students. In 1925, Central Block, a building whose front exterior is well recognised for its iconic and majestic pillars, was opened. During the period between the two world wars, student numbers were impressive despite the financial constraints –in 1939, 2,544 students enrolled. That grew to 3,100 in 1945. The period between 1947 and the 1980s was marked by considerable growth –student numbers increased rapidly to 6,275 in 1963, 10,600 in 1975 and 16,400 a decade later. In 1951 the University awarded Ernest Oppenheimer Residence was formally opened in Parktown.

A century later, Wits’response to the coronavirus pandemic can be felt at both the local and global levels through its innovative research (including vaccine development), blended teaching and learning programmes, community initiatives, and social activism . Today, we are confronted with a myriad of complex planetary problems including i nequal ity, erratic energy supply and crime, lack of governance and ethics, the intersection of communicable and non-communicable diseases and pandemics .

The university continues to make a positive impact on society from its locale in the Global South as it remains true to its values, which include searching for and standing up for the truth, holding those in power to account, acting with integrity, entrenching proper governance systems, guarding academic freedom and institutional autonomy, tolerating differences of opinion, and standing up for democracy, justice, equality and freedom .",

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account. Witsies are changing the world in all spheres – Rory Byrne served as the chief engineer for Ferrari, John Burland saved the leaning tower of Pisa from falling, and Professor Bavesh Kana is helping to make the testing for tuberculosis more accurate.

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account. Witsies are changing the world in all spheres – Rory Byrne served as the chief engineer for Ferrari, John Burland saved the leaning tower of Pisa from falling, and Professor Bavesh Kana is helping to make the testing for tuberculosis more accurate. There are many more such wonderous stories, of talented alumni, developed at Wits University, who are using their talent, knowledge and savviness to change the world, for good.",

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account. Witsies are changing the world in all spheres – Rory Byrne served as the chief engineer for Ferrari, John Burland saved the leaning tower of Pisa from falling, and Professor Bavesh Kana is helping to make the testing for tuberculosis more accurate. There are many more such wonderous stories, of talented alumni, developed at Wits University, who are using their talent, knowledge and savviness to change the world, for good.",

They are institutions that usually outlast multiple generations. Research-intensive universities like Wits should strive to create new knowledge and apply this for the benefit of society.” Speaking at Wits University’s Founders ’Tea during the university ’s Centenary Celebration in September, former deputy chief justice and former Wits chancellor Justice Dikgang Moseneke said universities must take a lead in the reformation of the country.",

Between 25% and 27% of patients are burnt as a result of violence, frequently gender-based violence. About 1% are made up of patients who have tried to commit suicide,”he says. A deeper acknowledgement of the lived reality of the vulnerable is what grounds the work of the Wits Law Clinic. The mission of the 40-year-old clinic is to ensure better access to legal advice and legal recourse, towards a more inclusive and equitable society. These access gaps were starkly clear during the hard Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020. Clinic director Daven Dass says, “The need was huge. Our phenomenal staff and students at the Wits Law Clinic continue to do the work they do, epitomising the spirit of ubuntu and the value of being the change they want to see in the world.” The Claude Leon Foundation Water Stewardship Programme tackles the deepening climate crisis and its impact on people and planet. This programme includes two research chairs for a transdisciplinary approach to water stewardship and postgraduate water research, worth R15.7m. The programme recognises that social inequality means that the climate crisis disproportionately burdens the poor.

A true place of higher learning and teaching should be focused on asking why we have so much poverty, and why it is increasing and so stubborn and endemic? Why are there fewer and fewer people who are capable of being innovative and creating new wealth and new ways of better living ? ”asked Moseneke.

We can help bridge the divide but we don’t have any time to waste.” Professor Adam Habib, former vice-chancellor of Wits, believes collaboration between institutions in the Global North and South that will lead to “clusters of excellence” is the path towards addressing both structural inequalities in the higher education sector and in society. “We envision cross-continental teaching and learning on the grounds to assist in stemming the ‘brain drain’and enable scientific and technological capacity to remain on the African continent,” said Habib. The higher education sector, and universities in particular, provide a platform for innovation, new knowledge creation, high-level and scarce skills development and the incubation and exchange of ideas. Universities are also treasure troves of knowledge that need to be protected, valued, guarded and strengthened . Professor Ruskana Osman, senior deputy vice-chancellor: academic at Wits, points out: “Research - intensive universities will have to learn to make optimum use of resources and develop an anticipatory consciousness rather than a reactive one. “The 2020 global pandemic has taught us first-hand that we need to be able to anticipate challenges so that we are not blindsided when they hit universities and society.” The Origins Centre explores and celebrates the history of modern humankind.

The planetarium has been a popular city fixture since it opened its doors in October 1960. In pre- pandemic days it welcomed around 60,000 people each year. In 1956 the Johannesburg City Council decided a planetarium would be the perfect hurrah for a city celebrating its 70th birthday. Wits donated the land, cementing a city and university partnership, and welcomed a unique asset to campus . Zeiss, the German manufacturer of the star projectors, was not able to manufacture a new projector in time that year, so the Hamburg Planetarium offered to sell their projector to Wits. Over the years the planetarium has hosted dozens of live and pre- recorded shows that have ranged from ancient Egyptian astronomy to exploring major celestial events like solar and lunar eclipses. It has also been the venue for numerous launches and talks. “Following the Apollo 11 moon landing, the planetarium was one of the first places in SA where people got to watch the recordings of Neil Armstrong ’s first steps on the lunar surface.",

Like an IMAX theatre experience —just better. “Many researchers across many fields feel as if we are basically drowning in data. “At the same time, data sets are becoming more complex and more multidimensional. A resource like Wits ’new Digital Dome is a way of honing a more intuitive understanding of big data,”s ays Deane . The technology will be a boon to science and research, while also hitting the sweet spot for entertaining and educating a modern-day public. As an example, Deane says, it could be three- dimensional shows made from drone footage swooping through the world’s largest radio telescope, the Square Kilometre Array (SKA), or visualisingwhat the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, in Switzerland, is measuring as particles are smashed together.",

The planetarium has been a popular city fixture since it opened its doors in October 1960. In pre- pandemic days it welcomed around 60,000 people each year. In 1956 the Johannesburg City Council decided a planetarium would be the perfect hurrah for a city celebrating its 70th birthday. Wits donated the land, cementing a city and university partnership, and welcomed a unique asset to campus . Zeiss, the German manufacturer of the star projectors, was not able to manufacture a new projector in time that year, so the Hamburg Planetarium offered to sell their projector to Wits. Over the years the planetarium has hosted dozens of live and pre- recorded shows that have ranged from ancient Egyptian astronomy to exploring major celestial events like solar and lunar eclipses. It has also been the venue for numerous launches and talks. “Following the Apollo 11 moon landing, the planetarium was one of the first places in SA where people got to watch the recordings of Neil Armstrong ’s first steps on the lunar surface.",

All the Wits facilities, including the Origins Museum, Planetarium and Wits Art Museum were open to the public, hosting an assortment of exhibitions, film screenings and theatre performances such as the annual Yebo Gogga festival and the last-ever shows of the old Zeiss Star Projector in the Planetarium. Giving voice to Wits’ commitment to freedom of speech and social activism, the weekend’s festivities climaxed with the multigenerational star-studded Free People’s concert, with a special tribute performance to alumnus Johnny Clegg, by his son, Jesse Clegg, as well as other former Witsies, such as Claire Johnston from Mango Groove and a special guest appearance by Vusi Mahlasela . The younger generation of Witsies, meanwhile, got a chance to dance the night away with performances by hip-hop great, Big Zulu, and Samthing Soweto. The weekend was not just about festivities, however, as Witsies of generations past and present were honoured by the unveiling of Wits ’ Scholarship boards, and alumni and SRC reunions.

Between 25% and 27% of patients are burnt as a result of violence, frequently gender-based violence. About 1% are made up of patients who have tried to commit suicide,”he says. A deeper acknowledgement of the lived reality of the vulnerable is what grounds the work of the Wits Law Clinic. The mission of the 40-year-old clinic is to ensure better access to legal advice and legal recourse, towards a more inclusive and equitable society. These access gaps were starkly clear during the hard Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020. Clinic director Daven Dass says, “The need was huge. Our phenomenal staff and students at the Wits Law Clinic continue to do the work they do, epitomising the spirit of ubuntu and the value of being the change they want to see in the world.” The Claude Leon Foundation Water Stewardship Programme tackles the deepening climate crisis and its impact on people and planet. This programme includes two research chairs for a transdisciplinary approach to water stewardship and postgraduate water research, worth R15.7m.

To ensure they remain relevant in a changing world, universities must transform themselves. They need to be collaborating not only with other higher education institutions around the world, but also with the private and public sectors to help solve the problems that our country faces, including inequality and climate change.",

We can help bridge the divide but we don’t have any time to waste.” Professor Adam Habib, former vice-chancellor of Wits, believes collaboration between institutions in the Global North and South that will lead to “clusters of excellence” is the path towards addressing both structural inequalities in the higher education sector and in society. “We envision cross-continental teaching and learning on the grounds to assist in stemming the ‘brain drain’and enable scientific and technological capacity to remain on the African continent,” said Habib. The higher education sector, and universities in particular, provide a platform for innovation, new knowledge creation, high-level and scarce skills development and the incubation and exchange of ideas. Universities are also treasure troves of knowledge that need to be protected, valued, guarded and strengthened . Professor Ruskana Osman, senior deputy vice-chancellor: academic at Wits, points out: “Research - intensive universities will have to learn to make optimum use of resources and develop an anticipatory consciousness rather than a reactive one. “The 2020 global pandemic has taught us first-hand that we need to be able to anticipate challenges so that we are not blindsided when they hit universities and society.” The Origins Centre explores and celebrates the history of modern humankind.

Wits recently hosted a reimagined “Free People’s Concert” in his honour, at which his son Jesse, also a Wits alumnus, paid tribute to his life. According to the founder of the Free People’s Concert, David Marks, “Wits University was one of the very few venues in the country where we could present mixed bands and audiences; it was a place where township and suburb could meet”. Another famous band was also started at Wits – Claire Johnston and many of the Mango Groove band members studied together at Wits and returned in 2022 as part of the Wits Homecoming weekend. The premiere of the musical King Kong was presented in 1959 in the Wits Great Hall to a mixed-race audience. It helped launch the careers of some of South Africa’s best-known musicians and singers including Miriam Makeba and Hugh Masekela, the latter who received an honorary doctorate from Wits. Sibongile Khumalo, Cecil Skotnes, Gavin Hood, William Kentridge, Phaswane Mpe, Gary Barber and Pieter Dirk-Uys are some of the artists who have shaped our world. Media stalwarts like Aggrey Klaaste, Ferial Haffajee, Fred Khumalo, Raymond Heard, Mathatha Tsedu and Dr Raymond Louw also walked Wits’ corridors – journalists not afraid to speak truth to power and to hold those in power to account.

These courses prepare you for a career in the commercial and related sectors of any economy. You can either take them as full-year courses across both semesters of the academic year, or as semester courses in the first or second semesters. In some cases, you must pass one course before proceeding to another. Two or Three Majors? The Wits BCom is a double major degree, which means you need to complete at least two full majors. But, in your second year, you can choose courses or modules that lead to three potential majors. By choosing three majors in your second year, you can start exploring areas of interest in more depth, but make a final decision later. You must have at least one major from Commerce, Law and Management (CLM); your second major could be from another faculty, like Science or Humanities. However, many students take both majors from disciplines offered within CLM. Still Deciding? Go General One of the great benefits of a Wits BCom General degree is that you don’t have to commit to your major choices in first year. Even if you choose one of the more specialised BCom fields of study (e.g. BCom in the field of Law or BCom in the field of PPE), you can easily move between degrees if you change your mind later. From second year onwards, BCom General students select their majors from either: Economics, Finance, Information Systems, Insurance and Risk Management, Human Resource Management, Marketing and Management; Courses offered in the The Wits Margo Steele School of Accountancy (i.e. Auditing, Taxation and Management Accounting); or Selected approved majors from other faculties.

Information Systems (IS) enable individuals, organisations and society to gather, store, organise, protect, retrieve, share and analyse information.

Information Systems are systems that allow individuals, organisations and societies to gather, store, organise, protect, retrieve, share and make sense of the information in their environments. In Information Systems, we study what happens when technologies, people, organisations and societies interact. Technology now lies at the heart of a dynamic, information and knowledge-driven world that needs people to point the way, people who “get it”. Our analysts solve “real world” problems, using technology to build systems that allow for quicker and smarter responses to changes in dynamic and complex environments. It is important to note that we focus on the design of end- to-end solutions of which technology may be an element and not only on technology for the sake of technology. This is what differentiates us from other disciplines such as Information Technology (IT), Computer Science and Software Engineering. CAREERS The analytical, technical, business and communication skills gained through the BCom with specialisation in IS can lead to a wide range of career choices, including: Business Analyst, Systems Analyst, Consultant, Analyst Programmer, Application Developer, Technology Architect, Database Administrator, UX/UI Designer, IT Auditor, Project Manager, Change Manager, Chief Information Officer. We regularly supply graduates to major professional services and banking organisations, including ABSA, Accenture, BCG, Deloitte, EY, First National Bank, Investec, Nedbank, PWC, Rand Merchant Bank and Standard Bank; technology organisations, including Amazon, Facebook, Google, Oracle and SAP; and telecommunications organisations, including Telkom, MTN and Vodacom.

While it is possible to enter an LLB at first year undergraduate level, you are encouraged to complete a BCom or BA degree first, preferably with law as one of your majors. This gives you a feeling for general law subjects before you commit to studying law. It also develops your knowledge and skills in other disciplines, which will be useful when you practise law. If you want to work in corporate law, either for a law firm or in the legal department of large organisations, you should do a BCom (in the field of Law) with a second major in Finance, Management, Accounting, Taxation, or any other BCom major. However, if you want to work in human rights law, family law, constitutional law, or international law, you should begin your legal studies with a BA (in the field of Law) and pair this with courses like politics, sociology, economics, or languages. Both the BCom (in the field of Law) and BA (in the field of Law) routes into the LLB include introductory and core LLB courses, taken over three years, which will be your majors.",

Chemical engineers are needed in fields such as plastics, oil refinery, explosives, fertilisers, detergents and food. Chemical engineering plays an important role in society by minimising and controlling the impact of modern industry on the environment, society and businesses. The curriculum therefore includes courses on environmental engineering, management principles and professional practice and ethics. Courses such as Chemical Engineering Thermodynamics, Chemical Reactor Theory, Process Control, Solid Fluid Systems, Transport Phenomena, Mass-Transfer Operations and Chemical Plant Design are studied after first year. In final year, you will study elective subjects in advanced chemical engineering topics. You need a thorough understanding of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry and must be computer literate.",

International Qualifications:  Closing Date: 30 September Sustain the environment and develop economic and social wellbeing. The Bachelor of Science in Urban and Regional Planning BSc(URP) programme, offered by the School of Architecture and Planning, is concerned with sustaining the environment and developing economic and social wellbeing. In a context of increased technological change, rapid urbanisation, social transformation and a changing natural environment, planning is about efficient and effective space management and places with meaning and quality. The programme covers a range of fields, including geography, economics, sociology, property studies and mathematics. Core planning subjects range from the design of urban spaces and principles of place-making in a culturally diverse context, to policies for the planning and management of entire spatial regions. The classes involve mostly small group teaching and expose you to real-life issues during practical field trips. Planners often work in large companies with property portfolios, like insurance firms and in communities, NGOs and independent consultancies. If you achieve the minimum requirements at the end of the three-year BSc(URP) programme, you may register for the professional BSc(URP) Honours programme, which enables you to register with the South African Council of Planners (SACPLAN) after you have gained necessary practical experience.

PROFESSOR NITHAYA CHETTY The Faculty of Science is proud to have many NRF A-rated researchers and SARCHI chairs, as well as a number of international collaborations. T his is an exciting time to be a part of science because science drives the modern world in which we live. Scientific research over the centuries has been the basis for the technology that we enjoy today. There are many challenges facing the world brought about by an ever-increasing population and the enormous pressures this is putting on our limited resources and environment. Scientific research is going to be a source for finding sustainable solutions. Data science methods, machine learning and artificial intelligence are important emerging new endeavours to help with decision-making in a wide range of activities and these ideas have their roots in science. Finding cheaper, more efficient and environmentally friendly energy sources is a big challenge for humanity, and the future solutions will emerge from science. All Schools, Institutes and Centres in the Faculty are actively engaged in pursuing research of the highest international standards. It is within this milieu of excellence that we are transforming society and developing the next generation of scientists. Our academics are strongly involved in public engagement activities, and Wits is growing its intellectual linkages with the rest of the African continent.",

International Qualifications:  Closing Date: 30 September Study how bioinformatics is used to select and describe computational results. This programme, offered by the School of Molecular and Cell Biology, helps you to understand how bioinformatics is used in the scientific field. This includes how to select, describe and use basic bioinformatics tools and how to interpret computational results. You will learn the history and application of bioinformatics, as well as algorithm, pipeline and software development and analysis and the transfer and storage/database development of genomics data. You will also explore gene expression data analysis, protein structure, functional genomics and genome analysis. Bioinformatics is important to genetic research because the large-scale, complex data that is generated in genomics simply would not make sense without contextual knowledge of how life forms work.",

But which career path should you pursue? And how can you acquire a realistic appreciation of the world of work? The Counselling and Careers Development Unit (CCDU) can help. 1. If you’re in Grade 11 or 12, schedule a career counselling session with a Career Practitioner. This will help you clarify your career goals, align your subject choices with your career aspirations, and identify suitable career paths to make an informed decision. Sessions are available both in person and online for your convenience. Contact the Unit for an appointment. 2. If you’re a Grade 11 or 12 learner, a current university student or an adult considering a mid-career change, you could also consider doing a Psychometric Career Assessment (at a fee). Contact the Unit for more information. This programme uses both computerised and written psychometric assessment tools to evaluate your learning potential, interests, personality and values to assist you in choosing suitable study and career options. The Unit also offers a range of support services to students once they embark on their journey at Wits. These services are aimed at helping students to be the best possible versions of themselves while at Wits.",
